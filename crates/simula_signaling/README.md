## How it works

WebRTC allows direct connections between peers, but in order to establish
those connections, some kind of signalling service is needed.
`simula_server` is such a service. Once the connections are established,
however, data will flow directly between peers, and no traffic will go through
the signalling server.

The signalling service needs to run somewhere all clients can reach it over
http or https connections. In production, this usually means the public
internet.

When a client wants to join a p2p (mesh) network, it connects to the signalling
service and provides a room id. The signalling server then notifies the peers
that have already connected about the new peer (sends a `new_peer` event).

The existing peers then send back WebRTC connection offers through the
signalling service to the new client, each of which the new client responds
with an "answer". Once the peers have enough information about each other, a
WebRTCPeerConnection is established for each peer, and an unreliable, unordered
data channel is opened.

All of this, however, is hidden from rust application code. All you will need to
do on the client side, is create a new socket, and give it a signalling server url
and a room id.

You will then get notified whenever a new peer data connection has been
established, and you will get all packets from peers in a single channel.
Packets include a boxed `u8` slice and the corresponding client's id.

Similarly, you can send packets to clients using a simple non-blocking method.
