So much of AI is about compressing reality to a small vector space, like a video game in reverse.

## GStreamer

### Ubuntu
```
cargo run --release -p sandbox --features gif,gst
```

### OSX
To get started with GStreamer in macOS, both the runtime and development packages, where they must be installed via the official GStreamer website: https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/#macos

In addition to install GStreamer, also itâ€™s necessary install GStreamer plugins via Homebrew:
```
brew install gst-plugins-base
```
```
brew install gst-plugins-rs
```
After installation, you also need to install `pkg-config` (e.g. via Homebrew) and set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/pkgconfig${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:+:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH}"
```
And finally run this command in the projects terminal
```
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/lib cargo run --release -p sandbox --features gif,gst
```
